# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Renewable Energy Systems ✨

## Overview 📈

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on renewable energy systems data. The aim is to gain insights into renewable energy trends, sources, and usage patterns to support data-driven decision-making in energy policy and sustainability initiatives. This analysis provides a detailed examination of various renewable energy sources, including solar, wind, hydro, and bioenergy, by leveraging open datasets.

## Project Structure 🗂️

- **`renewable_energy_eda.ipynb`**: The main notebook where the EDA is performed. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, and insights generation steps.
- **`data/`**: Folder containing datasets related to renewable energy (not included in this repository but should be placed here by users).

## Objectives 🧮

1. Perform a detailed exploratory analysis of renewable energy data.
2. Visualize trends, outliers, and correlations between various renewable energy sources.
3. Understand energy generation capacities, consumption trends, and their changes over time.
4. Provide recommendations based on the findings for energy policy or further analysis.
